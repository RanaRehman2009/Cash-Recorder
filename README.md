# Cash Recorder
This projects was created just so I can easily track my cash payments without having to go through the trouble of going to excel/google sheets and fill init in myself.

- [ ] Basic taking inputs from console and inputing it into a json/csv type file, and a reading mode as well (all in a command line interface)
- [ ] Using a GUI to take inputs and to read, maybe use a database for storing the info
- [ ] A clean gui that is easy to read and use, and used by many around the globe (.exe)

## Info and Libarys
After research about how I could store the data, I settled on SQLite or something like that.
